Hints + Notes: 
- the HTML is already created so you do not need to alter the `index.html` file.  

- The `<div class="mini-items-container">` has a width of 100%

- `<div class="big-items">` have widths of 20% 

- Some properties you may consider: `display: flex`,  `flex-wrap`, `justify-content`, `flex-basis`.

If you cannot recall what the flexbox properties do, You may want to use this [flexbox cheatsheet](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) as a resource.
